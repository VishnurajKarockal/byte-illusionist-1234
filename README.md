  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - React

- **State Management:**
  - Redux

- **UI Libraries:**
  - Chakra UI
  - Tailwind CSS

- **Backend and Server**
  - Our website utilizes a JSON Server as the backend to handle data storage and retrieval. This server is responsible for managing dynamic data, such as user login,user registration,add new post,etc.. 
    The JSON Server allows for a simplified and efficient way to mock a backend API during the development phase.
    
- **JSON Server**
  - We have implemented [JSON Server](https://mock-api-39gi.onrender.com/) to simulate a RESTful API. This lightweight server is easy to set up and provides a convenient way to manage data 
    without the need for a full-fledged backend.

## Project Overview
